Here is a good collection of the protobufs I found when looking at the SharkClean App version 2.5.35 for Android. 
I have been able to compare some of it to the MQTT messages I captured in the systemlog, and it works. 
I am running into an issue with some messages seem to be partially complete, and I can't find how the messages are trimmed.
